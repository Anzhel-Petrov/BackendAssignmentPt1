# BackendAssignmentPt1
First part of the Backend mendatory assignment of the web shop. This project is based on Adam Freemans' application in his book series "Pro ASP.NET Core 3" and "Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 2".
### Implementation details:
- A static "dummy" data repository class used to initialize all objects and simulate a database.
- Primarily using ViewBag to pass data to the views (weakly/loosely typed views)
